# Shubodaya Kumar - Cybersecurity Portfolio

I built this single-page site to showcase my Security Operations work, labs, and credentials. It runs on React + Vite and is deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Live Site
- https://shubodaya.github.io/portfolio-sec/ (auto-published from `main`)

## What You'll See
- Animated hero with my location, availability, and quick actions for resume and contact.
- Experience cards that separate responsibilities from achievements for each role.
- Project gallery spanning SOC labs, security automation, compliance benchmarks, and testing.
- Skills slider with an interactive “SOC Live Logs” panel that streams simulated alerts.
- Education timeline and certification badges for fast credibility scanning.
- Contact form powered by Web3Forms for direct inbox delivery.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with Vite 7 for a fast SPA build.
- React-Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS, plus animate.css + react-on-screen for scroll reveals.
- react-multi-carousel for the skills slider and supporting carousel libraries for media.
- Deployed via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages (`vite.config.js` base: `/portfolio-sec/`).
